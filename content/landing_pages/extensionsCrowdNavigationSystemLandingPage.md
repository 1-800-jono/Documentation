# Navigation Mesh

![Generated Navmesh ](/img/extensions/navigation/NavMeshGeneration.png)

A Navigation Mesh (or navmesh for short) is a surface topology describing the space where an agent can go based on constraints.
Based on parameters like agent radius, agent climbing capability, agent height,... the navmesh generation computes a topology from source meshes (the world geometry).
Then, this topology can have a debug display (blue mesh on screenshot above) to validate the parameters.
