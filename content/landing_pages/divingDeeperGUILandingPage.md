# Graphical User Interface
There are a number of options for adding a GUI to Babylon.js. The **Babylon.GUI** is covered in this section. It allows you to place buttons and labels within in 3D space as well as a 2D front of screen GUI. When you want a GUI that works in VR or within the 3D space it the only option. It is integrated within the playground. For your own projects it has to be loaded as well as Babylon.js

Other possible GUIs are:
1. CastorGUI a Babylon.js a community extension which overlays the scene
1. Dat.GUI, an external interface
3. HTML

## CastorGUI
An alternative 2D GUI is the extension [CastorGUI](/extensions/CastorGUI) with [documentation](/extensions/CastorGUI). It has to be loaded both for the playground and for your own projects.

It can be found on [github](https://github.com/dad72/CastorGUI)

## Dat.GUI
 The external [dat.GUI](https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage) is integrated within the playground. For your own projects it has to be loaded as well as Babylon.js

## HTML
Since Babylon.js is in JavaScript it is possible to use HTML and CSS to overlay the Babylon.js scene
