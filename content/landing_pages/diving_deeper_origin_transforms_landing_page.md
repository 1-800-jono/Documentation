## Transformations About the Local Origin

In this section we will only be looking at examples of the effects of changing the position, rotation and scale of a mesh based on its center of transformation being its local space origin. A later section will consider changes of center of transformation using parents, pivots and matrices. In this section the transformation of one mesh in terms of the frame of reference of another is tackled by the method of cooordinate transformation. It is also possible to transform the mesh vertices coordinates and so effectively changing the center of rotation, this process of baking transformations is described although it should only be necessary in exceptional circumstances.
