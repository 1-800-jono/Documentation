# Welcome to Getting Started with Babylon.js

Welcome to the wonderful 3D world of Babylon.js and 3D on the web. Whoever you are, game, app or web creator or just exploring, this is where you start learning about Babylon.js. Whatever your expertise in these areas, from beginner to a seasoned hand or somewhere in between, we are sure you will find something of interest. Beginners to coding in JavaScript should be able to learn a lot from the examples, however we strongly suggest that you gain a working knowledge of JavaScript before starting to develop your own projects .

In moving through Getting Started we introduce you to the features of Babylon.js. We present code examples using our playground, show you how to add models to your website and how to import your own models into your Babylon.js game or app. Once you have covered all the chapters you will be aware, at a foundation level, of what Babylon.js has to offer you. When you are ready, our full range of docs will help you dive deeper into Babylon.js. One day soon you will find yourself part of the Babylon.js community creating new ways to work with Babylon.js and, who knows, contributing to it as well.
