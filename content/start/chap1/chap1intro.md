# First Steps

Now it is time to start our learning journey together. Instead of the usual 'Hello World' introduction we will, step by step, build a simple world. At the end of the journey we will have created a small village demonstrating the features of Babylon.js. The first steps will introduce you to the basics of using Babylon.js to create a scene, code a simple model and export it. We will also show that you can import a model into a scene, display it on the web or create a web app from it.
