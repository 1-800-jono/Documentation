# Tiled Ground
## MeshBuilder
Example :
```javascript
var tiledGround = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateTiledGround("tgd", {subdivisions: {w:4, h:6} }, scene);
```

option|value|default value
--------|-----|-------------
xmin|_(number)_ map min x coordinate value|-1
zmin|_(number)_ map min z coordinate value|-1
xmax|_(number)_ map max x coordinate value|1
zmin|_(number)_ map max z coordinate value|1
subdivisions|_( {w: number, h: number} )_ number of subdivisions (tiles) on the height and the width of the map|{w: 6, h: 6}
precision|_( {w: number, h: number} )_ number of subdivisions on the height and the width of each tile|{w: 2, h: 2}
updatable|_(boolean)_ true if the mesh is updatable|false

## Mesh
Thanks to forum user Kostar111 for this handy Tiled Ground constructor. Here is the basic code needed to create a tiled ground.

```javascript

var precision = {
    "w" : 2,
    "h" : 2
};
var subdivisions = {
    'h' : 8,
    'w' : 8
};
var tiledGround = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTiledGround("Tiled Ground", -3, -3, 3, 3, subdivisions, precision, scene, false);
```

Parameters are: name, xmin, zmin, xmax, zmax, subdivisions = the number of tiles. (subdivisions.w : in width; subdivisions.h: in height), precision = the number of subdivisions inside a tile. (precision.w : in width; precision.h: in height), scene, updatable.

Kostar111 was also kind enough to give us a fine tutorial about how to use tiled grounds. [Click right here](http://makina-corpus.com/blog/metier/how-to-use-multimaterials-with-a-tiled-ground-in-babylonjs) to view it. At that link, Kostar111 thoroughly explains how the tiled ground works, and also provides some Babylon.js Playground scenes that nicely demonstrate some of its many uses.
