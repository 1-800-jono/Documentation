## Distant Hills
It would be possible to create hills from meshes however there is another way to add vertical height to a ground mesh. This is achieved using a height map which uses shades of gray to determine the height of the ground. White areas are the highest parts and black the lowest.
This simple height map

has a large black area in the middle to host the village, the white areas create the hills and the graying arms ways out of the valley for roads.
