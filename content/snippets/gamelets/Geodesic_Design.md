## Overview
In this design we restrict both polyhedra to ones built from an icosahedron base. A Geodesic polyhedron is built from a number of isosceles triangles. A Goldberg polyhedron is the dual of a Geodesic one and vice versa. A dual of a polyhedron swaps faces for vertices and vertices for faces.

The simplest class of Geodesic polyhedra splits each face of an icosahedron into isosceles triangles.

More complex classes are formed by rotating, with restrictions, the isometric grid formed by the isosceles triangles that split each face.

## Geodesic Classes

An icosahedron is formed from 20 primary isosceles triangles. Rather than rotating the underlying grid we demonstrate the classes by rotating a primary triangle on a fixed isometric grid.

Rotations are formed by applying two positive integers *m* and *n*. From a fixed point O (0, 0) on the isometric grid form a point A (m, n) which is m horizontal units from O and n units along the positive gradient line. The primary triangle is formed with a point B such that OAB is an isosceles triangle. The Geodesic polyhedron so formed will be noted as GD(m, n) and its dual the Goldberg polyhedron as GP(m, n);
