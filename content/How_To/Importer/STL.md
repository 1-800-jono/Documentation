# STL File Import

You can find the STL loader [here](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/dist/preview%20release/loaders)

To use it you just have to reference it after Babylon.js:


```
<script src="Babylon.js"></script>
<script src="babylon.stlFileLoader.js"></script>
```

Then you can use one of the static functions on the `SceneLoader` to load.
See [how to load from any file type](/divingDeeper/importers/loadingFileTypes)
