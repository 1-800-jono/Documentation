# Clone
This simply creates a deep copy of the original mesh and saves memory by sharing the geometry. Each clone can have its own material and transformation.

## Examples
Shows shared geometry by scaling one geometry by 2 https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#QMFPPE  
Shows transformation by scaling of 2 only changes one mesh https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#QMFPPE#1  
Different materials https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#QMFPPE#2
