## Clone
This simply creates a deep copy of the original mesh and saves memory by sharing the geometry. Each clone can have its own material and transformation.

## Examples
Shows shared geometry by scaling one geometry by 2: <Playground id="#QMFPPE" title="Cloning Example 1" description="Simple example showing shared geometry by scaling one geometry by 2." image=""/> 
Shows transformation by scaling of 2 only changes one mesh: <Playground id="#QMFPPE#1" title="Cloning Example 2" description="Simple example showing transformation by scaling of 2 only changes one mesh." image=""/>
Different materials:  <Playground id="#QMFPPE#1" title="Cloning Example 3" description="Simple example of clones with different materials." image=""/>
