## Clone
This simply creates a deep copy of the original mesh and saves memory by sharing the geometry. Each clone can have its own material and transformation.

## Examples
<Playground id="#QMFPPE" title="Cloning Example 1" description="Simple example showing shared geometry by scaling one geometry by 2."/> Shows shared geometry by scaling one geometry by 2.  

``` ```
<Playground id="#QMFPPE#1" title="Cloning Example 2" description="Simple example showing transformation by scaling of 2 only changes one mesh."/> Shows transformation by scaling of 2 only changes one mesh.  

``` ```
<Playground id="#QMFPPE#2" title="Cloning Example 3" description="Simple example of clones with different materials."/> Different materials.
